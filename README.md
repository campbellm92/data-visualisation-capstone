# Localis

*by Matthew Campbell, Gary Cazzulino & Amrit Maharjan*

This is a Queensland University of Technology capstone project completed in conjunction with [Localis](https://www.localis.co/), a 
data localisation company based in Brisbane, Australia.

The application comprises a data visualisation dashboard with custom frontend and 
backend solutions developed for local governments and businesses interested in data for the tourism industry in Queensland, Australia. 




### Our stack consists of:

- React and Tailwind CSS for UI components created for the dashboard
- Recharts for graphing
- Node.js/Express for backend APIs 
- A MySQL database

### Technical enhancements include:

- Authentication and authorisation with JWT
- Deployment with Heroku
- State management using React Context API
- Security considerations including hashing

### Known issues:

- Sidebar not resizing properly at the /dashboard endpoint in the deployed version of the app

The project is live and can be viewed [here](https://localis-capstone-f7a22eb1b92e.herokuapp.com/).
